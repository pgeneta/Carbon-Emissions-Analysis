# Summary of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates a dataset containing historical emissions data from various entities, including state-owned and investor-owned organisations, across different commodities such as oil, natural gas, and coal. The analysis aims to understand the distribution of emissions and production values, identify key contributors to global emissions, and uncover trends over time.

**Key Insights:**

1. Skewness in Emissions: The data reveals a right-skewed distribution of emissions and production values, indicating that a small number of entities are responsible for a significant portion of emissions.
2. Commodity Influence: "Oil & NGL" and "Natural Gas" are the most common commodities in the dataset, contributing heavily to emissions.
3. Parent Type: State-owned entities are significant contributors to global emissions, reflecting the large-scale operations of government-controlled enterprises.
4. Time Series Trends: Emissions have generally increased over time, with notable spikes during periods of industrial growth, aligning with global energy demands and industrialisation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Target High-Emission Entities: Implement policies focused on the top emitters, particularly state-owned entities, to achieve substantial emissions reductions.
2. Accelerate Renewable Energy Transition: Shift away from fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy adoption through subsidies, regulations, and infrastructure investment.
3. Enhance Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises: Strengthen environmental regulations and encourage innovation within state-owned enterprises to reduce their emissions.
4. Commodity-Specific Strategies: Develop tailored strategies for different commodities to effectively reduce emissions in each sector.
5. Adaptive Policy Frameworks: Establish continuous monitoring and adaptive policies to ensure that emissions reduction efforts remain effective and responsive to global changes.
This analysis provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies to reduce emissions and promote sustainable practices across various sectors.
